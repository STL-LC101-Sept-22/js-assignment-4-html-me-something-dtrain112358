         <h2> Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</h2>
         <img src="/images/plane" alt="Picture of a plane crashing">
      <p>Thank you for joining me on my quest! the begining of my journey is a scary one. I have been over seas twice. Once with my annual high school's senior class trip program and another time was in my first year of college
         with my travel abroad group. I was maybe one of the few that went out my class. I had been saving my money ever since i started working odd jobs for a family friend growing up and this seemed like a such a great opportunity
         to use this money to see the world abroad. However, I am deathly afraid of flying! While this isnt my first time on a plane, this is the first time in a plane for almost an entire days worth of time. On the way over i dont think
         i moved from my seat or unbuckled my seatbelt for the entire ride. After we landed and they were able to pry me from my seat cushions. The story began.....

      <h2> God save the Queen!</h2>
      <img src="/images/London" alt="Picture of Buckingham Palace">
   <p> This is the first stop getting off the plane. London is a great place to visit. We definitely hit some of the most famous spots including: Tower of London(<strong>where we saw the crown jewels!</strong>), Buckingham Palace (as pictured), 
      and took a tour around this great city to see Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. We also spent some time at one of the largest malls in the world. I cant remember the name of the mall at the time but it was definitely a sight to see. If ever
      given a chance to go you should definitely ride the subway system on london. </p>
   <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>The Original Hard Rock Cafe</li>
      <li>A store called Eatmyhandbagbitch (True story! it did exist at the time)</li>
      <li>The Chunnel</li>
      <li>Changing of the guard</li>
      </ul>

   <h2> When in Rome!</h2>
   <img src="/images/Rome" alt="Picture of the Colloseum in Rome">
<p>Italy! This has to be my favorite places to visit in my experience so far. There is so much history and architecture here. If you notice my highlights for this country is rather long and there is so much more to see.
   IF you ever go i would reccomend that you see Venice first. It really is a workout to walk around the city but there is so much history under your feet. From the tiny walkways and bridges it really is a sight to see. 
   One of my favorite things about florence is the artistic feel. anywhere you walk you are immersed into the land of the artists. if you ever get the chance you will understand what i mean. 
</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><strong>Gondolas!!!</strong></li>
         <li>Saint Marks Square</li>
         <li>Piazas, All of them!</li>
         <li>Venice, Italy</li>
         <li>Florence Leather Market</li>
         <li>Colloseum - the picture shown is not my picture but i have stood in this exact spot and took a similar picture and then I had some real italian gelato</li>
         <li>REAL! Italian Gelato - there is no substitute!</li>
         <li>Italian Pub Crawl</li>
         <li>Tuscany - Chanti, Italy - is just like you see in the movies with even more details in real life!</li>
