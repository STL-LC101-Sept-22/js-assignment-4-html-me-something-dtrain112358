      <p>Thank you for joining me on my quest! the begining of my journey is a scary one. I have been over seas twice. Once with my annual high school's senior class trip program and another time was in my first year of college
         with my travel abroad group. I was maybe one of the few that went out my class. I had been saving my money ever since i started working odd jobs for a family friend growing up and this seemed like a such a great opportunity
         to use this money to see the world abroad. However, I am deathly afraid of flying! While this isnt my first time on a plane, this is the first time in a plane for almost an entire days worth of time. On the way over i dont think
         i moved from my seat or unbuckled my seatbelt for the entire ride. After we landed and they were able to pry me from my seat cushions. The story began.....

      <img src="/images/London" alt="Picture of Buckingham Palace">
   <p> This is the first stop getting off the plane. London is a great place to visit. We definitely hit some of the most famous spots including: Tower of London(<strong>where we saw the crown jewels!</strong>), Buckingham Palace (as pictured), 
      and took a tour around this great city to see Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. We also spent some time at one of the largest malls in the world. I cant remember the name of the mall at the time but it was definitely a sight to see. If ever
      given a chance to go you should definitely ride the subway system on london. </p>
   <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>The Original Hard Rock Cafe</li>
      <li>A store called Eatmyhandbagbitch (True story! it did exist at the time)</li>
